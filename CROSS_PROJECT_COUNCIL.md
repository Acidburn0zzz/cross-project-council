# Cross Project Council (CPC)

In this document we will collect requests, recommendations, requirements, and draft language for the Cross Project Council's charter.

Charters are legal documents. The Node.js Foundation and the JS Foundation will provide legal support to draft and review the final document. We will have ample chance to review, ask questions, revise, and refine this document over the next few months.
