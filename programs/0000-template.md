# Program title goes here

## Summary

> One paragraph explanation of the program.

## Motivation

> Why are we doing this? What use cases does it support? What is the expected outcome? What core Foundations values does this program support?

## Detailed design

> This is the bulk of the RFC.

> Explain the design in enough detail for somebody familiar with the Foundation to understand, and for somebody familiar with the governance to implement. This should get into specifics and corner-cases, and include examples of how the program will be used. Any new terminology should also be defined here.

## How we teach this

> What names and terminology work best for these concepts and why? How is this idea best presented and communicated to the target consumers? How will the administering TLC support its function and growth?

## Drawbacks

> Why should we *not* do this? Please consider the impact on the community, on the integration of this program with other existing and planned programs, on the cost of execution, etc.

> There are tradeoffs to choosing any path, please attempt to identify them here.

## Alternatives

> What other designs have been considered? What is the impact of not doing this?

> This section could also include prior art, that is, how other Foundations or organizations in the same domain have solved this problem.

## Unresolved questions

> Optional, but suggested for first drafts. What parts of the design are still TBD?
