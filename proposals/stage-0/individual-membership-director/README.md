## Individual Membership Representation Proposal

Stage 0

### Description

Board representation

The Individual Membership program will bring together the ecosystem around $FOUNDATION projects, users who are not current contributors, that we want to feel more engaged and welcoming than other languages, through participation, input, and accessing the benefits of the foundation that have historically been perceived as available only to contributors. This program codifies a relationship with our ecosystem, as an opportunity for member companies to feel more connected with the members of the Individual Membership through systematic communication building.

In order for the Individual Membership Director to provide high fidelity context on the Board, this seat on the Board would only exist with a threshold contingency: once the individual membership roster hits 2000 active members, an election would be triggered for representation on the $FOUNDATION Board of Directors. The term of the elected seat would be for one year. When the year terminates, only if the 2000 person threshold is maintained would a new election occur.

The process for updating the Individual Membership Director seat requires addressing:

- Who is eligible to nominate and run for a Directorship role 
- Who is eligible to vote for candidates for a Directorship role 
  

The Individual Membership Director candidates are to be nominated by voting members of the top-level committees of projects and the CPC. Any relevant person may be considered for candidacy regardless of whether they are a member of the Individual Membership program. The active members of the Individual Membership program would then vote via our proposed election system on the candidate of their choosing.

Responsibilities of the Individual Membership Director

- Individual Director gives those in the $FOUNDATION projects ecosystem a voting voice on the board to provide highly relevant context for steering the Board in making informed decisions that are best for the future of $FOUNDATION projects.  
- Meet and report quarterly with CPC to coordinate the needs of their representative groups 
- Coordinate at least one annual event that interfaces the Board of Directors with the Individual Membership class(ex: Town Hall) 
- Provide feedback on how proposed board items might impact the $FOUNDATION projects ecosystem represented as individual members and can provide suggestions on how the $FOUNDATION can better support the community. Coordinate with the Foundation to contribute the resources the community needs to maintain and grow a healthy relationship with the ecosystem. 
- Solicit feedback and data that represents the wishes of other individual members and the community at large with the assistance of the CPC. They have been entrusted with the duty to make decisions based on the information they receive to best represent the community, and can gather input for proposals when relevant and granted permission to do so. 
- Participate and vote in Board meetings. This includes legal considerations, budgeting and approving Foundation-led conferences and other initiatives.  
- Introduce and drive forward initiatives to conclusion that capture the mission of the Node.js project while taking advantage of the resources the Foundation has at its disposal, whether community or executive. 
- Represent the Board at speaking engagements  
- Participate and observe relevant $FOUNDATION ecosystem meetings in order to deliver monthly updates to the Board.  
- Deliver monthly documented updates to the members of the Individual Membership class on what the Board and Foundation are doing. They have been entrusted with the duty to make decisions based on the information they receive to best represent the community, and can gather input for proposals when relevant and granted permission to do so by the Board. 

### Required Resources

What resources would be needed to execute it?

- Administrator for elections, tooling, and communications coordination for membership with Director 
- Tooling: membership management system and election system 

### Who would be responsible?

The CPC would own the maintenance and sustainability of the programs along with the Individual Membership Director and would be aided by the Executive group with resources of the $FOUNDATION to execute.

### How would success be measured?

Given the goals outlined in this proposal,

- NPS score improves by 10% after base is established 
    - With the introduction of better feedback mechanisms, we should be able to move some detractors to passives, and some passives to promoters. 

- Annual survey from membership reflects confidence in Director as effective 

### Why this proposal is important

With the historical data we have regarding individual membership, if Board Directors wish for the Individual Membership to be representative of the larger Node.js engaged ecosystem, we know that the number and makeup of the prior votes was not statistically significant nor representative. The Individual Membership did not have a clear path, role, or definition. 

The goals of the Director should include:

- To give a voice and direction to the individual membership program through the responsibilities defined in this document. 
- To improve the individual membership program itself through leading initiatives that encourage members of the Board and the project to collaborate on the health of the program 
  
How does this program achieve this?

- Provides the interested but not yet fully engaged members the path to engagement and voice 
- Operationalizes programs that focus on folks who are more engaged and interested in giving and getting feedback outside of the collaborator base on the project and foundation work through guaranteed communications, surveys, better evangelists prepared with exclusive information ahead of the world to provide this value. 

### What is necessary to complete this proposal

Approval of this proposal from project members of the NF and JSF, the Node.js Board of Directors, and the JSF Board of Directors
