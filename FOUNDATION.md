# Foundation Recommendations Document

This document is for the initial phase of work for the Bootstrap team to draft requirements that overlap with scope of the Board in order to provide an outline and structure for the foundation attuned to the needs of the projects and ecosystem stakeholders who have participated.

Defining how the Foundation / Project interface will be an iterative process, and this is the start of it!

## Mission Statement Drafts
Project joining the foundation should collectively agree on a _single mission statement_ when joining the new Foundation. Below are a number of recommendations put forward by attendees of the Governance breakout session(s) at our Node.js Collaborator Summit 2018 in Vancouver.

> By providing structure and support to build and sustain community among open-source projects.

> Growing and maintaining the global JavaScript system through open, equitable, and inclusive governance.

> The Foundation is dedicated to the development and sustainability of the JavaScript ecosystem, through fostering the environment for growth of JavaScript related projects.

## Values
The following values were identified in the governance brainstorming exercises during the October 2018 Collaborators Summit in Vancouver. We believe they can operate as guiding principles for Foundation efforts.

### Community Focus

### Project Driven
> TODO: Add definition and examples. (@amiller-gh, since I have the sticky notes from the exercise)

### Transparent Operation

### Simple Structure

## Top Level Committees and Representation
> TODO: Flesh this out better with the current working model of the two Top Level Committees (CPC and C3)
>       and their representation that was discussed, as is needed to be defined by the *board*'s
>       by-laws *only*. Details on TLC operation, membership, and more detailed responsibilities
>       can be described in their own governance docs.
- Project representation on the Board
  - Projects could have tiers, only 'platinum' projects should sit on the Board directly. Other projects would have shared seats (like gold/silver member structure)
  - Community representation on the Board: 1 seat guaranteed for the Cross Community Council and 1 seat for Individual Membership program if and only if threshold requirements have been met (TODO: detail this more)
  - Each council (CPC and C3) should have a given allocation of Board seats. How these are allocated should be defined by each respective council.
- Board must establish Cross Project Council focused on the specific needs of the member projects
  - Allow projects to self-organize amongst themselves. Processes are defined and driven by project e.g. CPC is not structured by the Board
  - CPC should be co-chaired by the Executive Director of the foundation

## Foundation Expectations
- Communicated scope for the foundation and board
- Annual reviews of staff, NPS, board, programs, support services to projects for accountability and incremental improvement
- The Foundation staff, executive director, and board should follow a "servant leadership" style.
- Non-corporate member representation in budget / finance subcommittee
- Projects values should drive foundation focus and priority
- No "pay to play" in technical participation
- Earmarking allowed with flexibility in budgeting for concerns and needs of individual projects
- Value satisfaction: regular feedback from projects
