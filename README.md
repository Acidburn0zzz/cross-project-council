# Node+JS Foundation Bootstrap

This is the operating repository for the Node+JS Bootstrap Team.

The Node+JS Bootstrap Committee is the temporary body tasked with managing community recommendations for the transition of the merged Node+JS Foundation to a permanent governance model.

The files in this repository are living documents and will never represent finished governance. Once we reach consensus on governance, this repository will be archived and the documents will be moved to their new home in a foundation specific Github org.

Until such a time that this group has consensus on a new governance model, and the Foundation has legal squared away, all projects, programs, and committees will continue to operate unchanged.

Upon enactment of this new governance model ("Ignition"), this working body will be disbanded.

> Note: If there is to be an extended Bootstrap transition committee to, for example, provide oversight in the organization's first year, those criteria must be defined as a new program in the proposed governance model. There is no extension of **this** specific group's life-cycle.

## Definitions
Throughout this repository we may use assorted acronyms and jargon to describe many complex concepts. This language is subject to change as we iterate on proposals. To help onboard and level-set, we will maintain an active list of commonly used language here. If you see domain specific language used in this repository that is not represented here, please add it!

| Vocabulary | Definition |
|---|---|
| Bootstrap | This repo, team, and process. |
| Ignition | The decision to move forward with the new governance |
| Contributor | You, and anyone that interacts with this repo. |
| TLCs | The Top Level Councils of the project – Currently the CPC and C3 (defined below) |
| CPC | A new proposed Top Level Committee – The "Cross Project Council |
| C3 | A new proposed Top Level Committee – The "Cross Community Council |
| CNCF | The Cloud Native Computing Foundation (Prior Art) |
| COC | Code of Conduct |
| MVF | Minimum Viable Foundation. The bare minimum governance documentation to operate a function joint foundation |
| RFC | Request For Comments. The feedback and iteration process followed in the `/programs` directory. |

## Deliverables
The deliverables from this body will be:

  - [ ] A recommendations document to help inform the new Foundation's by-laws (Goal: November 1st)
  - [ ] A recommendations document to help inform the TLCs' charters (Goal: ???)
  - [ ] A collection of fully drafted governance documents required for Ignition. "Minimum Viable Foundation" (MVF). (Goal: March 1st)
  - [ ] A collection of program, initiative, and governance recommendation documents not required for MVF. After Ignition these will be passed to the appropriate bodies (CPC, C3, etc.) to execute.

## Operations

Bootstrap follows a [Consensus Seeking][] decision making model.

> Outstanding Questions:
> If full consensus can not be achieved for a particular PR, what is the fallback voting structure?
> If full consensus can not be achieved for Ignition, what is the fallback? 2/3rds supermajority of CommComm, TSC and TAC? Something else?

The Code of Conduct explains the *bare minimum* behavior
expectations the Node.js Foundation requires from all contributors.
[Please read it before participating.][COC]

To begin contributing to working groups and initiatives, start participating!

The [`/programs`](./programs) directory contains instructions and templates for a standard RFC process for new Foundation programs proposals. To propose a new program that the joint Foundation may want to administer, please follow the directions in the `/programs` folder's [README](./programs/README.md).

The [`/governance`](./governance) directory is meant as a staging ground for more well fleshed out governance documents that will closely – if not exactly – represent governance documentation that will be use to guide day to day operation of the TLCs, working groups, and projects in the Foundation. All documents in here should be the execution of accepted RFCs from `/programs`. This group will prioritize fully drafting program RFCs that are marked as required for MVF.

### Committee Co-Chairs
The committee will be co-chaired by representatives from the TSC, CommComm and TAC. At the time of writing these are:

- Joe Sepi (CommComm)
- Michael Dawson (TSC)
- ??? (TAC)

Together they will maintain regular order, help guide conversation, and ensure regular progress is made toward deliverable goals, and Ignition.

> Editor's Note: Quite literally just made this up. Not sure if Michael wants this responsibility and I don't have a rep in mind for the TAC side. Thoughts? There may also be benefit to just having one or two leaders here. Joe and I (Adam) already volunteered to take it on – and are still happy to do so – but wanted to float the idea of full TLC representation.

## Committee Meetings

Bootstrap will meet weekly at the time(s) identified for best possible attendance. Anyone may attend the regular meetings. It will be the co-chairs' responsibility to ensure every meeting has a well-defined agenda and meetings are conducted in an orderly fashion.

Meetings are broadcast via Zoom. The join link is published just before the meeting begins in the meeting issue. We also stream meetings straight to YouTube so anyone can listen to it live, or view a recording at a later date. Meetings should be streaming and archived at https://www.youtube.com/c/nodejs+foundation.
