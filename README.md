Mission statement of the projects moving into the foundation â€“ what we think the Foundation's mission should be. Projects should collectively agree on a _single mission statement_ when joining the new Foundation.

- By providing structure and support to build and sustain community among open-source projects.
- Growing and maintaining the global JavaScript system through open, equitable, and includisve governance.
- The Foundation is dedicated to the development and sustainability of the JavaScript ecosystem, through fostering the environment for growth of JavaScript related projects.
