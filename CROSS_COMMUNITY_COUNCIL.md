# Cross Community Council (C3)

In this document we will collect requests, recommendations, and requirements for the Cross Community Council's charter.

Charters are legal documents, and we should not be writing legalese! (Can you say: liability?) The Node.js Foundation and the JS Foundation will provide legal support to draft the official document. We will have ample chance to review, ask questions, revise, and refine this document over the next few months.

To give the lawyers a good foundation to start with, can will capture our wants here in plain English.
